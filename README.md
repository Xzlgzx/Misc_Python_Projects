# Instruction for Automate_PDF_Bulk_Action.py
Last updated: 2019-08-21

This program reads in a PDF file, and outputs resized, individual pages of the PDF that contains a certain string (without spaces)

1. Make sure Python is downloaded and added to System Path 
2. Download the latest Windows Poppler binary, unzip it, and add the file to System Path https://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/
3. Make sure all the libraries used in the code 
4. Code can be a bit slow as it does a lot of work in the background. Once running, it requires zero supervision. 
5. Double click on the .py file and follow instructions
6. Use any IDE to edit (I used Sublimetext on some of Witmart's computers)
